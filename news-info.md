## News Info Provider
 
I published my app in Google Play and it gets recent announcements and eclass announcements in my app. 
I get them via rss and show them in my app. The owner of the news is University of Piraeus (Greece).

The app doesnt modify the news title inside the app. It just shows them to the user and when the user clicks on one title, it redirects him to the official website in order to read the whole description.
